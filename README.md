**Background**
People have been through difficult times during the pandemic with the lockdown and testing positive for covid, which has severe impact on one’s health. This has brought into limelight the importance of eating good food and building immunity to safeguard oneself.

As a person is diagnosed with COVID virus he/she must go under isolation. This poses a challenge for the patient to shop and prepare food. The purpose of the project is to offer healthy meals to people at an affordable cost and deliver them. With the system we will be developing, users can use it to browse restaurants, their menus, select meal plans that suit them best and have them delivered to their doorstep.

Through “NutraMeals” website we present a comprehensive solution for meal planning and delivery. Its intuitive visual interface will make selecting healthy meal plans and placing orders easy and affordable for the users.

**Vision**

In COVID-19 pandemic situation, affected families are stranded at their home and are deprived of necessities like food and grocery supply.

“NutraMeals” will help such families to get their healthy daily meal at their doorstep. People can select healthy meal of their choice and we will link restaurants to such users in need. Also, Restaurants added to our website will essentially provide only healthy food options.

“NutraMeals” is a platform where people can order healthy food at affordable prices and Restaurants will provide food to them at their doorstep with contactless delivery.
